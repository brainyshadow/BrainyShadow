### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a student at the University of Waterloo who enjoys software development.

My intrest in technology started when I was a kid with remote control toys. This quickly evolved to FPV drones, then to Arduino, and then into software development.

My favorite projects at the moment are: 

- resume-maker
- secure-password-generator

Feel free to create a pull reqeust on any of my projects if you have an idea or suggestion. I'd love to hear your feedback.
